Bimanual Robots
=================

.. _bimanual_robots:

DexSuite also supports bimanual robot configurations, which involve two robot arms operating in a shared workspace. This is not a specific robot model, but rather a configuration of two separate robots (either Modular or Integrated) + a layout.

(Coming Soon)
