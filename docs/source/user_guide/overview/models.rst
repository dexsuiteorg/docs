Models
====================
Models are the building blocks of an environment in Dexsuite.

Arenas
--------------------
Arena starts by building plane then  walls then table from a YAML spec.

-  plane, walls, table blocks are optional (enabled: false)
-  All z-coordinates are lowered by `table.height` so the
   table-top ends up exactly at world z = 0.


Robots
--------------------
Robots are made up of a manipulator and a gripper, where we will cover in greater detail in the dedicated robot section. In a bimanual environment, two robots are presents.
